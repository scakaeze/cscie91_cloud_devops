# CSCI-E91 Course Description

This course covers a deep dive into the DevOps revolution, enabling students to become more efficient and effective in overcoming day-to-day IT infrastructure challenges. We have designed this course keeping in mind what modern DevOps engineers require to fully utilize the resources at hand. Students can automate and build configurations for infrastructure and servers, addressing areas such as automation, continuous deployment, containerization, and monitoring. By the end of the course, students gain skills in making services and infrastructure in the cloud more resilient by learning configuration management (Puppet, Ansible), continuous deployment, integration with several DevOps tools and techniques such as cloud APIs, and Linux skills/scripting toward resource automation and optimization. Students learn two cloud service providers; Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform to achieve rapid application deployment and management across cloud resources.
